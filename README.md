# Bundle_newsfeed
This repository works on providing ranks to the news articles based on multiple factors 
explained clearly in the python codes within the repo.

The main file is Bundle.py and the other file is a supporting py file for some modules ( Person_score, Publish_score )

The url4 field is something we can fiddle with to test various news articles.

The score recieved can be used in various ways as required.
